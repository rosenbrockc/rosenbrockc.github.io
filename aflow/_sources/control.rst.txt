Query Constructor
=================

The AFLUX requests are compiled by a :class:`~aflow.control.Query`
class that is accessed via the :func:`~aflow.control.search` function. It
supports chaining of methods to construct the relevant query. Each of
the methods is described below, though we recommend looking at
:doc:`examples`.
